Contract Class For Nontent Provider :
we created nested class for accessing the tables
for mentioning the columns we can write the constans in each table class separately but sometimes columns
maybe be repeated in different classes so to remove this redundancy we make an interface for column constants .
these interfaces group related constants together and also this process simplifies the organisation and
maintainence of the constants.
these interfaces are nested within our contract classes
But are not intented to be used directlt outside the provider
So we make them as protected
Now if the table wants to associate the column constants they need to implement particular interfaces .

public static final class Courses implements CoursesColumns >>>
if we want to access course_title column >>> Courses.COLUMN_COURSE_TITLE
